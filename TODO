7) [x] Choose datetime data type
8) [z, >] Bug in test("DB - add, get and remove task")
9) [z] Generalize gets in DB
10) [z, -] Change Queries to String subclass
11) [-] Remove Unit - all functions should return something
12) [-] Separate Config for Secrets
13) [z] Combining mutiple filters into one; duck typing
14) [z] replace if/else constructions in DBFacade.getListOfProjects by case/match (data types and methods)
15) [z] replace if/else constructions in DBFacade.filterProjects by case/match (pattern matching results data flow resembling tree graph,
which do not resemble actual flow)
16) [ ] remove race condition in tests
17) [x] check why reset do not remove projects
